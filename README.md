# TRADE-DEPORT ANALYTICS
# Introduction
 This is a personal project I decided to do after learning data analytics using Microsoft Excel. The process includes data profiling, data cleaning, data analysis, data interpretation, data visualization. TradeDeport is an e-commerce Store that specializes in selling products online. I've decided to analyze this data with the specific questions given.
# Questions
 •Analyse the number of orders by time of Day highlighting peak periods on the days.																			

 •Provide an analysis of Sales Volume by Producer also, showing the Number of Cases for each.													

 •Provide a ranking of products by number of customers who purchased them.									

 •What is the relative contribution of the sales channels to the top 5 products in this ranking. 												

 •Peak Delivery Time (Hours of the Day).	

 •Average Fulfilment Time per State.	

 •Fulfilment Rate by Delivery Agent.	

 •% of orders with late deliveries.	

# Tools
 Microsoft Excel
# Data profiling
 •Excel reveals that the data contains 8905 rows and 26 columns

 •The first column contains the Order date in which order was placed

 •Each Order No. In the second column Is unique to a particular customer name

 •The data contains 3 outlet types and 13 producers

 •The data consists of 2 countries(Nigeria and south Africa)

 •Sales are distributed with 3 Sales channel

 •Other columns contains the price, delivery time, delivery agent etc.
# Data cleaning
 •Currency: I changed the "Unit price(USD)" data type from number to currency.

 •Duplicates: I highlighted all cells and used the "remove duplicate" ribbon in excel to remove all duplicates.

 •Blank cells: unfortunately there wasn't any blank cell found.

 •New column: Added a column titled "Total" by multiplying the Unit Price(USD) x Quantity; this was created in order to know the total volume generated.

 
# Data Visualization
 •Created a new sheet in excel to visualize my findings.

# Result 
 •The "convenience store" had the highest number of orders.

 •Most orders were made 9AM.

 •"Unilever" had the most sales among producers.

 •Most orders were delivered within 11AM.

 •Product with late deliveries are within the "Fabric clean" category.

 •Total loss amount to $11,000.
